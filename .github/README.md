### Info
<p align="left">Please, do not contact me for requests for plugins, I hate Javascript (the language this <u>thing</u> was written in, it was mostly just a personal project. If things are unoptimized, submit a PR and I will <b><u>maaaaybe</u></b> take a look at it and merge.</p>

<p align="right">Oh yeah, you may want to get a theme for the plugin to work correctly. Themes change the layers of Discord around for it to work, and I am not planning on maintaining it when Discord changes their names for everything for that to break. I recommend [ClearVision](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6)</p>

```ini
[Default Settings]
UseVideoBackground = true
FlipVideoBackground = false
VideoBackgroundLink = 'https://universe.communitydragon.org/events/2021/arcane-nlex-hub-2021/videos/collection-jayce.webm'
```
